A little bit about us,

Hi, we're three Dawson College Students in the Enriched Science Program, Evan Parasol, Thomas Deleuze-Bisson and Alex Xia. As we share various common passions such as programming, physics, space and math, we've decided to participate in the 2024 Edition of the McGill University Physics Hackaton. Ever since we had figured out that astrophysics was a field that scared most people because of its complexity, we decided to make it our mission to demonstrate it in the simplest way possible and what better way to do so than to make an accessible, fun and diverse sandbox in which the powers of graviationnal fields, forces and accelerations can be observed.
