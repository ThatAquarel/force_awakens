## A Little Bit About Us

Three Dawson College Students in the Enriched Science Program. As we share common passions such as programming, physics, space and math, we've decided to participate in the **2024 Edition of the McGill University Physics Hackathon**. Ever since we had figured out that astrophysics was a field that scared most people because of its complexity, we decided to make it our mission to demonstrate it in the simplest way possible and what better way to do so than to make **an accessible, interactive and adaptable sandbox in which the powers of graviationnal fields, forces and accelerations can be observed - and harnessed**.

## The Idea

- Taking the wonder of space and the beauty of orbital mechanics, to visualize them to the eyes of anyone by implementing a program that **simulates the orbits of celestial bodies around a black hole**.

- **Mass and gravitational pull of the bodies increasing** as it collisions happen between the orbiting bodies, to mirror how that happens in reality.

- Interactive and engaging for users: **a phone website where the user can launch planets with masses and velocities into the system**, so as to continually have more interactions between celestial bodies, the black hole, and each other.

## Project Structure

- `force_awakens/`: Root of Python package
    - `__main__.py`: Entrypoint
    - `app.py`: Rendering loop
    - `graphics/`
        - `draw.py`: Objects and planets drawing
        - `render.py`: OpenGL rendering helper functions
    - `mechanics/`
        - `mechanics.py`: Body adding mechanics
        - `colors.py`: Body colors
        - `elements_in_space.csv`: Body properties
    - `web/`
        - `server.py`: Webserver for client connection and interactivity
        - `index.html`: Client side website
    - `images/`: Resources and loaded textures

## Requirements

The requirements for running the code are as follows:
- Flask==3.1.0
- glfw==2.7.0
- imgui==2.0.0
- matplotlib==3.9.2
- ngrok==1.4.0
- numpy==2.1.3
- pandas==2.2.3
- Pillow==11.0.0
- pygame==2.6.1
- PyOpenGL==3.1.7
- qrcode==8.0

## How it Works

1. **Gather data of various planets and other celestial bodies** across our universe such as exoplanets, stars, etc. using tools such as NASA's Eyes on Exoplanets. 
    - We **obtain an accurate representation** of what each known star and exoplanet looks like which abled us to draw their visual models. For planets from the Star Wars Universe, we looked trough various fan websites, approximations and even quotes from the movie to get their properties.

    - **Organize planet properties** in order to be able to plug them in our actual black hole model.

3. **Simulate body interactions with Newtonian Physics** and Euler Integration over timesteps, for each body pair interaction.
 
    -  We calculate seperatly the gravitational force, and **sum the forces exerted** by the different planets on the desired planet. We repeat this process for every single planet. In other words, we calculate the the sum of forces for every planets by adding all of the Fg that the other planets exert on it.

    - We then find their acceleration with **Newton's Second Law**. Their velocity using the acceleration and finally, their position using this velocity that gets integrated at 60Hz.

4. **Render simulated planets** and stars using OpenGL, with a user interface built in Imgui.

5. A website that is joinable by phone to **interact with the application in real-time**.
