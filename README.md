# A little bit about us,

Hi, we're three Dawson College Students in the Enriched Science Program. As we share various common passions such as programming, physics, space and math, we've decided to participate in the 2024 Edition of the McGill University Physics Hackaton. Ever since we had figured out that astrophysics was a field that scared most people because of its complexity, we decided to make it our mission to demonstrate it in the simplest way possible and what better way to do so than to make an accessible, fun and diverse sandbox in which the powers of graviationnal fields, forces and accelerations can be observed.

# What our projects consist of...

We've designed, as mentionned earlier, a sandbox where it is possible for users to add all sorts of celestial bodies ranging from black holes to various exoplanets, even including a few ones from you favorite shows in order to observe their graviationnal influence over each other in a neutral spatial environment and create an interesting and visual learning experience for the user. We think that such a project makes science more accessible to everyone as sometimes, just a visual representation of something makes us understand a concept so much better.

# How it works

Now let's get into the interesting part; how the project works ! First, lets deconstruct it into a few steps... 1. Exoplanets scouting, gathering of data and accurate representation of celestial bodies, 2. Development of an 3d gravity neutral envrionment to oberve the behavior of planets using OpenGUI, 3. Implementation of matrixes to evaluate the "planet throwing" feature of our project using linear algebra.

# 1. Data gathering

We started by looking on various NASA websites for exoplanets and information about them, such as mass, radius, and distance from the earth. Then we began researching the various libraries that we would plan to use in the making of our project, such as openGL, glfw, and imgui. Finally, we researched the information that would be needed to simulate gravity between celestial bodies, as well as attempting to figure out methods of properly displaying black holes.
